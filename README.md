# Apollo GraphQL Todo App

A simple todo list app which support adding tasks and subtasks which is built by `Hasura`, `Heroku` and `React`.

Other technologies are included `Typescript`, `Express`, `Nodemon`, `React`, `GraphQL`, `Apollo`, `Material UI`, `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for our unit and integration tests.


## Available Scripts

This project is powered by yarn.

Once cloned, you have to install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.

⚠️ As I've used free version of `Glitch` service for serving the Hasura actions, you might feel some delay when completing a task! 

These are some useful scripts:


### `yarn install`

Install all the required dependencies


### `yarn start`

Start the application


### `yarn test`

Run all of our unit and integration tests.
